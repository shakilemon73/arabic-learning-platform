Fix Video SDK Multiple Participants & Real-time Broadcasting Issues
Context
I'm building a video SDK similar to Zoom but facing two critical issues:
Only showing single person instead of multiple participants on screen
Real-time video/audio broadcast not working properly
Current Setup
Please provide this information when using the prompt:
Framework/Technology: [e.g., WebRTC, Socket.io, React, vanilla JS]
Backend: [e.g., Node.js, signaling server details]
Current code structure: [paste relevant code snippets]
Browser console errors: [any WebRTC or connection errors]
Network setup: [STUN/TURN server configuration if any]
Specific Help Needed
1. Multiple Participants Display
Please analyze my code and help me: - Create dynamic video containers for multiple participants - Implement proper participant management (join/leave handling) - Fix UI layout to show multiple video streams simultaneously - Ensure each participant gets unique video element ID - Handle video stream assignment correctly 
2. Real-time Broadcasting Issues
Please help me diagnose and fix: - WebRTC connection establishment problems - STUN/TURN server configuration for NAT traversal - Audio/video stream handling and broadcasting - Peer-to-peer connection management - Media constraints and codec compatibility - Browser permission handling 
Code Review Request
Please review my code for: 1. WebRTC implementation best practices 2. Signaling server logic 3. Media stream handling 4. Error handling for connection failures 5. Cross-browser compatibility issues 6. Performance optimizations for multiple streams 
Expected Output
Please provide:
Root cause analysis of both issues
Step-by-step fixes with code examples
Complete working code snippets for: 
Multiple participant video display
Proper WebRTC connection handling
Signaling logic for real-time communication
Debugging steps to identify future issues
Best practices for video SDK development
Testing recommendations for different network conditions
Additional Requirements
Explain WebRTC connection states and how to handle them
Provide error handling for common failure scenarios
Include fallback mechanisms for connection issues
Suggest monitoring/logging for production debugging
