# üîß Critical Setup Required - Database Tables Missing

## Issue
Your Arabic Learning Platform is showing a Bengali error "‡¶Ö‡¶®‡¶®‡ßÅ‡¶Æ‡ßã‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶§ ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶ü‡¶ø" (Unauthorized Error) because the Supabase database tables don't exist yet.

## Solution
You need to create the database tables in your Supabase project:

### Step 1: Access Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard at supabase.com
2. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar

### Step 2: Run Database Setup
1. Copy the entire content from the file `database_setup.sql` (located in your project root)
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute the script

### Step 3: Verify Setup
After running the SQL script, you should see these tables created:
- `users` - User profiles and progress
- `course_modules` - Course content organization  
- `instructors` - Teacher information
- `live_classes` - Class schedules
- `class_attendance` - Attendance tracking
- `payment_records` - Payment processing
- `homework_submissions` - Assignment management

### Step 4: Test the Application
Once the database tables are created:
1. Refresh your application
2. The Bengali error should disappear
3. Authentication and user profiles will work correctly
4. You can test login/register functionality

## What the Script Does
- Creates all necessary database tables with proper relationships
- Sets up Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection

‚úÖ Live class scheduling
‚úÖ Payment processing
‚úÖ Progress tracking
‚úÖ Homework submission system

The application is designed for Bengali speakers learning Arabic to understand the Quran and Hadith better.
