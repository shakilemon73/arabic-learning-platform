- **Video Infrastructure**: WebRTC with TURN servers and SFU architecture.
- **Deployment**: Vite-only frontend with Replit host configuration.

## Database Design
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with real-time capabilities.
- **Schema**: Comprehensive tables for users, courses, live classes, instructors, attendance, and session storage.
- **Features**: User progress tracking, payment status, course enrollment status, and attendance records.
- **Real-time**: Supabase real-time subscriptions for live features.

## Payment Processing
- **Provider**: Bangladeshi mobile banking (bKash, Nagad, Rocket) for course enrollment payments.
- **Integration**: Local payment methods with manual verification for Nagad/Rocket and automated verification for bKash.
- **Security**: Payment records stored in PostgreSQL with status tracking.

## Authentication & Authorization
- **Provider**: Supabase Auth (previously Replit Auth in development) for user management and authentication.
